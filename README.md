# linear-regression-for-Machine-Learning---Without-Importing-any-Libraries

This code is a simple demonstration of how the linear regression in machine learning works.
Here I NOT using any of the libraries or Built-in functions(except basic functions, never use functions for machine learning).
I make intermediate values to be print. because noobies can easily kkknow how the algorithm works.
