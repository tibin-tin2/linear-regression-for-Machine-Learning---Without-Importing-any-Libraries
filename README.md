# linear regression for Machine Learning - Without Importing any Libraries

This code is a simple demonstration of how the linear regression in machine learning works.
Here I NOT using any of the libraries or Built-in functions(except basic functions, never use functions for machine learning).
I make intermediate values to be print. because noobies can easily kkknow how the algorithm works.


<b>Linear Regression</b>
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.
